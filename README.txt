The Three-Player Game of War: Asger Jorn Tribute Edition is a necessary departure from Guy Debord's Game of War for two players. Dialectics, in its rigidity, has succumbed to the spectacle, becoming yet another gear in the vast machine that mediates our reality, dictating a perpetual conflict between thesis and antithesis. This duality, though masquerading as expansive, traps thought in a narrow corridor, flip-flopping between two walls, sublating syntheses until the end of days, forever. It acknowledges not the spectrum, but the binary; it speaks not of fluidity, but of absolutes. In triolectics, we find the revolutionary potential for constructing situations - moments of life deliberately constructed for the purpose of reawakening authentic desire, passion, and engagement with the immediacy of existence. Triolectics acknowledges a third force, an often chaotic and uncontrolled element that exists not just outside the conventional binary but as a transformative and rebellious energy. It is the synthesis that refuses to be absorbed, that alters the very fabric of the thesis and antithesis. The third force in triolectics ignites an unpredictable quality, fuelling the spontaneity and autonomy that the spectacle seeks to extinguish. The Three-Player Game of War embodies this triolectic spirit, introducing a dynamic interplay of forces that challenges the conventional two-player paradigm and offers a canvas for the emergence of unpredictable and transformative energies. In the Three-Player Game of War, we seize the opportunity to break free from the dialectical straitjacket, embracing the liberating chaos of triolectics as a means to subvert the spectacle's grip on our perception of reality, and therein lies the revolutionary potential for authentic human connection and the reawakening of the genuine spirit of existence.
